# VOLUNTEER-CLOUD
Abstract - Volunteer Cloud is one of the most popular example of Cloud Computing which takes resources from the general crowd who themselves volunteer to participate. The term Volunteer Computing can be easily summarized using two words: “computational” and “participative”. The computational part basically includes the allocation of small computing tasks to different machines volunteered by the general public, whereas the term participative implies the user’s perspective and their contribution in making this venture a success. This paper thus talks about the participation aspect of the users, the factors which influence the users to be a part of volunteer computing. It also includes a Reputation Management Model which helps in the estimation of the reputation of the nodes who serve as volunteers for the system.
